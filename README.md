## Product Description
For people who wish to film themselves in a non-selfie fashion, Robot Filmmaker is a robotic system that will track and record videos of a given person or object.  Unlike video drones, our product will reduce the need of human control during the filming process so that the person being filmed can focus on the task they want recorded and not the recording process itself!
