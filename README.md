## Product Description
For people who wish to film themselves in a non-selfie fashion, Robot Filmmaker is a robotic system that will track and record videos of a given person or object.  Unlike video drones, our product will reduce the need of human control during the filming process so that the person being filmed can focus on the task they want recorded and not the recording process itself!

## Repository Description
  - **Archives:** Archive of backups and unused code and pictures
  - **Demo:** Demo-ready code
    - Demo_Main.py: Main function.  Forever loop that reads commands from the Android phone app.
    - Demo_Training.py: Training function called in Demo_Main.py when Android phone app sends command to start training.  Starts  mugshots to get face samples, then sends samples to S3 bucket and does training on cloud.  Leaves an XML model file on the cloud.
